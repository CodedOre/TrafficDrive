# TrafficDrive

*A vehicle simulation in Godot*

## Introduction

This is a vehicle simulation created for an university project, created by Frederick Schenk.

## Running the project

You can find binaries of this project under the [Releases](https://github.com/CodedOre/TrafficDrive/releases) page of this repository.

If you want to run the project itself in Godot, you'll need access to the assets, which are in an separate repository due to license-restrictions, so this is not runable by itself.
